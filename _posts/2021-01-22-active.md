This is an intermediate box from HackTheBox where you must exploit a vulnerable domain controller. It is really great becuase it is really rare that you get this opportunity. I found this really easy, because I did half of it earlier (Jan 20) , but couldn't finish it because all my requests kept timing out because HackTheBox was undergoing maintenance (I think), so I felt like I knew exactly what to do.

This would be a good box for beginners to learn about Active Directories. It could probably be rated easy not medium.
Note: I am working on explaining my steps more. I don't know how good I am at doing that.

## Scanning:

Finding open ports and running services:

![](/assets/images/active_htb/Screenshot_from_2021-01-22_20-15-03.png)

Starting by checking for null shares

## SMB

Using smbmap we can list shares, and what permissions we have for them.

We can see that we have read access to the Replication share:

![](/assets/images/active_htb/Screenshot_from_2021-01-22_20-15-41.png)

Use smbclient to access the Replication share:

![](/assets/images/active_htb/Screenshot_from_2021-01-22_20-16-33.png)

The folder active.htb suggests the domain is active.htb, so for efficiency we can add the following line to /etc/hosts:
```
    10.10.10.100	active.htb
```
Check each directory for information, download all files that might be helpful:

![](/assets/images/active_htb/Screenshot_from_2021-01-22_20-18-25.png)

We find file Groups.xml in the folder
```
active.htb\Policies\{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}\MACHINE\Preferences\Groups\Groups.xml
```
This file contains the following:

![](/assets/images/active_htb/Screenshot_from_2021-01-22_20-18-48.png)

The group policy file contains credentials:
Group Policies for account management are stored on the Domain Controller in ‚ÄúGroups.xml‚Äù files buried in the SYSVOL folder.

The tool gpp-decrypt was found to decrypt the cpassword in Groups.xml file.

[https://github.com/t0thkr1s/gpp-decrypt](https://github.com/t0thkr1s/gpp-decrypt)

Run the tool to retrieve the credentials from groups file:
```
python3 gpp-decrypt.py -f /home/crazyeights/Groups.xml
```
![](/assets/images/active_htb/Screenshot_from_2021-01-22_20-20-20.png)]

With these credentials we can check for further available shares:

![](/assets/images/active_htb/Screenshot_from_2021-01-22_20-21-40.png)

We now have access to NETLOGON, Replication, SYSVOL, and Users.

The Users share sounds promising.

Use smbclient to access the share Users.

![](/assets/images/active_htb/Screenshot_from_2021-01-22_20-23-36.png)

We can find the user flag in the folder SVC_TGS\Desktop:

![](/assets/images/active_htb/Screenshot_from_2021-01-22_20-24-12.png)

We know have user.txt:

![](/assets/images/active_htb/Screenshot_from_2021-01-22_22-16-09.png)

Use rpcclient to enumerate domain users, and groups:

![](/assets/images/active_htb/Screenshot_from_2021-01-22_20-31-29.png)

The next step is to get the Administrator's password.

We can use the impacket script GetUserSPN.py which gets service principal names that are associated with a normal user account.

If we can get a valid TGS for SPNs, then a TGS request encrypts the ticket with the account that the SPN is running under, which allows for bruteforcing of SPNs account NTLM hash
```
python GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip 10.10.10.100 active.htb/SVC_TGS -request
````
![](/assets/images/active_htb/Screenshot_from_2021-01-22_20-39-38.png)

We can copy and paste the Administrator hash to a text file and then use john to crack it.

![](/assets/images/active_htb/Screenshot_from_2021-01-22_20-40-32.png)

Now we have the credentials for the domain Administrator.

We can now check which shares the Administrator can access

Using smbmap to list shares and permissions:

![](/assets/images/active_htb/Screenshot_from_2021-01-22_20-41-24.png)

Lets check the share C$:

![](/assets/images/active_htb/Screenshot_from_2021-01-22_20-43-02.png)

We now have access to the C drive. We can retrieve the root hash:

![](/assets/images/active_htb/Screenshot_from_2021-01-22_20-43-25.png)

We now have root.txt:

![](/assets/images/active_htb/Screenshot_from_2021-01-22_22-16-22.png)

### To Get a Root Shell:

Use impacket script psexec, since the shared path is writeable we can use psexec to execute commands on the server:
```
python psexec.py active.htb/Administrator:Ticketmaster1968@10.10.10.100
```
