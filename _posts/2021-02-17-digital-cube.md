This is an easy forensics challenge from HackTheBox. It is pretty unique, and we get to do some programming which is neat.

Download the zip, and decompress it.

You get the following:

Since the challenge name is digital cube, and its a stego challenge, we can assume that we can turn this into an image, since there are 50x50 bits the image is a square.
```
Set each 1 to a black pixel
Set each 0 to a white pixel
```

Using python:

```python
from PIL import Image

cubetext = ""
with open("digitalcube.txt", "r") as f:
	cubetext = f.read()

width=50
height=50
image = Image.new("RGB", (width, height))
putpixel = image.putpixel
imgx, imgy = image.size

p = 0
for i in range(50):
	for j in range(50):
		if cubetext[p] == "1":
			putpixel((i, j), (0,0,0))
		else:
			putpixel((i, j), (255,255,255))
		p+=1
image.save("digital_cube.png")
image.show()
```

We get:
