The rsa_noob challenge from CTFlearn is an medium crypto challenge. Crypto is not my strongest area, so this was a good entry level challenge.

Download he file rsa_noob.txt from [mega.nz](http://mega.nz). Inside is the following text:

```
e: 1
c:9327565722767258308650643213344542404592011161659991421
n: 245841236512478852752909734912575581815967630033049838269083
```

Since I took a crypto course last term I probably should remember what those meant. I didn't and had to look it up.

```python
c = ciphertext
m = messsage
p,q - primes
```

This is from my notes:

When `e = 1` then d is also equal to 1 because `d*e = 1*mod(tot(n))`, so `d = 1*mod(tot(n))`

where:

`tot(n) = (p-1)*(q-1)`  

Since we know `d=1`  and since `c^1 = c`  then we can just convert the c integer to a byte string.

 `c`  contains some number of bytes, as the message is a byte stream/array (8-bit octets) encoded to an integer. When the message was encoded the array was looped over and each byte was OR-ed into a successively higher location in the output integer. 

We can reverse this operation by doing the following (found on stackoverflow):

```python
e = 1
c = 9327565722767258308650643213344542404592011161659991421
n = 245841236512478852752909734912575581815967630033049838269083

def integer_to_bytes(integer, _bytes):
    output = bytearray()
    for byte in range(_bytes):        
        output.append((integer >> (8 * (_bytes - 1 - byte))) & 255)
    return output

#print(len(str(c))) <- 55
print(integer_to_bytes(c, 54))
```

The function `integer_to_bytes` expects to extract `_bytes` bytes from `integer`. It repeatedly applies the bitmask 255 to `integer` to obtain the lowest 8 bits, and adds these bits to the output, then shifts `integer` right 8 bits.

Note that we don't need to use e, or n.

When we run this code we get:

We can see the flag at the end of the byte array.
