A very standard boot2root machine, beginner difficulty. A bit puzzle-y with some focus on enumeration, and stego. This is one of my older writeups and the format is a bit messed up.

### Scanning:

Initial scan to find the machine on the network

![](/assets/images/10/m1.png)

Full scan to get details about running services

### Web:

Enumerating the web server using skipfish:

![](/assets/images/10/m3.png)

We find file notes.txt

![](/assets/images/10/s1.png)

note.txt contains the following message

![](/assets/images/10/s2.png)

Visit the text file listed in notes.txt

![](/assets/images/10/s3.png)

These are credentials for SSH

### User:

Login to SSH:

#### User Flag:

### Root:

There is another user mhz\_c1f

![](/assets/images/10/m6.png)

Download the contents of the folder paintings found in their home folder:

![](/assets/images/10/m7.png)

#### Stego:

Use steghide to extract hidden file from “spinning the wool.jpeg”

![](/assets/images/10/m8.png) ![](/assets/images/10/m9.png)

Go back to ssh and login as mhz\_c1f:

##### Root Flag:

FIN.
