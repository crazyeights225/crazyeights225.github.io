Ramada is an easy reversing challenge from ctflearn. It is one of those challenges that is both easy and kinda hard at the same time. I got really stuck because the script I wrote to reverse some operations didn't round the integers correctly, it would have been easy otherwise.

When we run the challenge we see the following:

When we run it again with an argument to match the usage `Ramada CTFlearn{kernel}` we get:

Open it now with ghidra to analyse the source. Open the main function in the Decompiler:

![/assets/images/ramada/Screenshot_from_2021-03-10_21-01-23.png](/assets/images/ramada/Screenshot_from_2021-03-10_21-01-23.png)

In the source at line 49 we find the expected length of the flag:

```python
sVar4 = strlen((char *)__s);
...
if (sVar4 == 0x1f) {
```

Converting sVar4 `0x1f` to an integer is `31`

The `CTFlearn{}` part of the flag is `31 - 10 = 21`  

Generate a string of length 21 to test it:

```python
crazyeights@es-base:~$ python3 -c "print('CTFlearn{'+'A'*21+'}')"
CTFlearn{AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA}
```

When we run it with the correct length flag we get:

In the main function in the decompiler we can see that the function CheckFlag is called:

```python
iVar3 = CheckFlag((char *)aiStack104);
```

`CheckFlag()` is called with only the so-called kernel part of the flag as input, meaning it doesn't include the `CTFlearn{}` part.

Next we check the contents of the CheckFlag function:

In `CheckFlag()` function it loops through the user input, `iVar2` for each char in the string it is cast to int, and cubes it, and then compared to the corresponding int in the `data` array. We can assume that the flag is stored in `data`

Checking out the contents of data:

Since we know that `iVar2 * iVar2 * iVar2`  is equal to data if the user enters the correct flag. We can write a program that takes each entry in data and reverses the cube operation (cube root) :

```python
import numpy as np

data = [0x13693, 0x6b2c0, 0x11a9f9, 0x157000, 0x1cb91, 0x1bb528, 0x1bb528, 0xded21, 0x144f38, 0xfb89d, 0x169b48, 0xd151f, 0x8b98b, 0x17d140, 0xded21, 0x1338c0, 0x1338c0, 0x11a9f9, 0x1b000, 0x144f38, 0x1734eb]

s = ""
for d in data:
	s+=str(hex(round(np.cbrt(int(d)))))[2:]+" "
	
print(s)
```

 We get the following (with each entry being in hex):

When we get ascii representation instead we get:

![/assets/images/ramada/Screenshot_from_2021-03-10_21-57-14.png](/assets/images/ramada/Screenshot_from_2021-03-10_21-57-14.png)

The code is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

data = [0x13693, 0x6b2c0, 0x11a9f9, 0x157000, 0x1cb91, 0x1bb528, 0x1bb528, 0xded21, 0x144f38, 0xfb89d, 0x169b48, 0xd151f, 0x8b98b, 0x17d140, 0xded21, 0x1338c0, 0x1338c0, 0x11a9f9, 0x1b000, 0x144f38, 0x1734eb]

s = ""
for d in data:
	i = round(np.cbrt(d))
	s+=chr(i)
	
print(s)
```

When we run the ramada program with this string as the flag kernel we get:

We have found the flag ðŸ¥³

FIN.
