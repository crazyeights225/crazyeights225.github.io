You start with a virtual machine which you know nothing  about – no usernames, no passwords, just what you can see on the  network. In this instance, you'll see a simple community blogging  website with a bunch of users. From this initial point, you enumerate  the machine's running services and general characteristics and devise  ways to gain complete control over it by finding and exploiting  vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.<br />Your first goal is to abuse the services on the machine to gain  unauthorised shell access. Your ultimate goal is to read a text file in  the <code>root</code> user's home directory <code>root/flag.txt</code>).<br />This VM is designed to be holistic and fairly down to earth. I wanted  to simulate a real attack on a real website rather than just presenting  a puzzle box of disparate elements, and I wanted to avoid the more  esoteric vulnerable VMisms, like when you have to do signal processing  on an MP3 you found to discover a port-knocking sequence. Of course  there are always tradeoffs between what's realistic and what's optimally  fun/challenging, but I've tried to keep the challenges grounded.<br />Because this is a VM that you're downloading, importing and booting,  one way to achieve this goal would be to mount the VM's hard disk. I  haven't encrypted the disk or done anything to prevent this, so if you  want to take that route, go ahead. I'm also not offering a prize or  anything for completing this VM, so know that it will be entirely  pointless.<br />Because this is a VM running a real operating system with real services, there may be ways to get to <code>root</code>  that I did not intend. Ideally, this should be part of the fun, but if  they make the box entirely trivial I'd like to know about and fix them –  within reason. As of this release, I've installed all the updates  available for Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS, but I cannot and will not attempt  to patch this VM against every new Linux kernel exploit that comes out  in the future. So there's a hint – you don't have to use a kernel  exploit to root this box.<br />What you will need is a good HTTP intercepting proxy – I recommend <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp">Burpsuite</a> – and a couple of network tools like <code>nmap</code> and <code>nc</code>. You'll also need some virtualisation software – <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a> will be easiest for most people, but KVM and VMWare should also be able to import the <code>.ova</code> file after a bit of fiddling. Once you've imported the VM, put it on the same network as your attacking system (<a href="https://digi.ninja/blog/untrusted_vms.php">preferably don't give it internet access</a>) and start hacking!<br /><br /><a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/bob-101,226/">https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/bob-101,226/</a><br /><br />Difficulty: Beginner/Intermediate<br />Bob is my first CTF VM that I have ever made so be easy on me if it's not perfect. <br />The Milburg Highschool Server has just been attacked, the IT staff  have taken down their windows server and are now setting up a linux  server running Debian.

The time has come to select one courageous young  hacker for the honor of representing District 12 in the 74th annual  Hacker Games! And congratulations, for you have been selected as  tribute!<br />Hacking games and CTF’s are a lot of fun; who doesn’t like pitting  your skills against the gamemakers and having a free pass to break into  things?<br />But watch out, as you will find out, some games are more dangerous  than others. I have talked about counterattacks here before, and this  system has implemented a number of aggressive anti-hacker measures.<br />In fact, this VM is downright evil. I am probably legally obligated to tell you that it will try to hack you.  So if a calculator or message declaring your pwnedness pops up or shows  up on your desktop, you asked for it. But don’t worry, it won’t steal  your docs or rm you, it will just demonstrate compromise for the game.<br />To save precious bandwidth, this has been implemented in a minimal  tinycore-based VM, and will require VirtualBox to run. But vbox is free –  you can download it here: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads<br />Unfortunately, I didn’t have the time to add nearly all the things I  wanted to, so there are really just a few challenges, a couple of  counterhacks, and about 10 memes to conquer. Depending on your skill  level, you could pwn (or be pwned) in just a few minutes or in a few  hours. So hack it before it hacks you!<br />No sponsors are necessary, so don’t light yourself on fire. Simply  download the evil VM here: TheHackerGames.zip, start it, and open up  http://localhost:3000/ to begin. Now, you can totally cheat since you  own the VM, but see if you can beat the challenges without cheating.  Then you can go ahead and cheat, which should also be fun – you’re  probably comfortable with many physical access attacks involving the  hard disk, but this system doesn’t use a hard disk. So enjoy and  remember…<br />May the odds be ever in your favor!<br /><br /><a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/21ltr-scene-1,3/">https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/21ltr-scene-1,3/</a><br /><br /><br /><h3>Scene 1</h3><br />Your pentesting company has been hired to perform a test on a client  company's internal network.
