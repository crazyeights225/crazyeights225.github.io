      <p>Local Area Network, 1 owner 1 building, centralized control</p>
      <p class="text-info">Overhead</p>
      <p>excess time, memory, bandwidth used by a network to perform a specific task</p>
      <p class="text-info">Circuit Switched</p>
      <p>Traditional telephone model: a dedicated path through the network is established from source to destination. Resources are reserved for the duration of the session</p>
      <p class="text-info">Packet Switched</p>
      <p>Postal Model: No reservation of resources. Packets advanced along a predetermined path, or created on-line, 1 link at a time. Packets stored temporarily at each node on the path.</p>
      <p class="text-info">Multiplexing</p>
      <p>Sending multiple signals or streams over a communications link at the same time to form a complex signal. Recievers recover the seperate signals (demultiplexing)</p>
      <p class="text-info">What is the Cloud in the context of Networking</p>
      <p>The magical cloud shape in the every network diagram that shows interconnected networks what is it?<br>
      <b>A cloud is the unpredictable part of any network through which data passes between 2 end points. 
         Clouds exists because any 2 points in a packet-switched network, the physical path on which a packet travels can vary from one packet to the next and in a curcuit network, the specific curcuit that is set up can vary from one connection to the other</b>
      </p>
      <p class="text-info">What is a token ring?</p>
      <p>a LAN technology, a communications protocol, uses a special 3-byte frame called a token that travels around a logical ring of workstations or servers. (in a ring or star topology)

                <p class="text-info">Routing Tables</p>
                <p>contains an entry for each possible destination with the out-going link to use for destination, message delivery proceeds node-to-node one link at a time looking up the next link in the table</p>

                <p class="text-info">Network Units: Autonomous Systems (AS) </p>
                <p>An autonomous system consists of a number of subnets exchanging packets via routers that are using the same routing protocol</p>

                <p class="text-info">Distance Vector</p>
                <p>Based on Bellman-Ford Algorithm</p>
                <p>Initializes distance to the source to 0 and all other nodes to infinity.<br>
                For all edges, if the distance to the destination can be shortened by taking the edge, the distance is updated to the lower value.<br>
                At the ith iteration when edges are scanned, the algorithm finds all shortest paths of at most length i (in at most edges)<br>
                Uses the idea of shortest path routing, handles topology changes. Forms routing table as an array of tuples (destination, nexthop, distance)<br>
                To send a packet to a given destination, it is forwarded to the process in the corresponding nexthop field in the tuple<br>
                In a graph with n nodes, the distance vector D for each node i contains n elements D[i, 0] through D[i, n-1], where D[i, j] defines the distance of node i from node j<br>
                Initially: <br>
                D[i,j] = { 0 if i=j, 1 if j is a neighbor of i, infinity otherwise<br>
                Each node j periodically broadcasts its distance vector to its immediate neighbors<br>
                Every neighbor i of j, after recieving the broadcasts from its neighbors, updates its distance vector as follows:</p>
                <div class="math">  
               <pre lang="latex">
                     D[i, k]=min\textsubscript{j}\{w[i, j]+D[j, k]\}, \forall{k\ne{i}}
                </pre>
                </div>
                <p>When a node j or link crashes, some neighbot k of it detects the failure, and sets the corresponding distance D[j, k] to infinity<br>
                When a new node joins, or existing node is repaired the neighbor detecting it sets the corresponding distance to 1.<br>
                Following this, the distance vectors are corrected, and the routing table is recomputed</p>

                <p class="text-info">Link State Protocols</p>
                <p>Used by interior routing protocols<br>
                Each nodes maintains information in the state of all links of the network, formed from Link State Advertisements (LSAs)<br>
                When state of out going link changes, nodes broadcasts this information to all nodes in the network using flooding<br>
                Each node compares locally to its routing table</p>
                <p class="text-info">Calculating Maps and Shortest Paths</p>
                <p>First give a map of the network to each node by: 1) Determining the neighbors of each node, 2) Distributing the information for the map, 3)Creating the map <br>
                 Second: each node independently runs an algorithm over the map to determine the shortest from themselves to every other node in the network<br>
                 Nodes maintain 2 data structures: tree containing list of completed nodes, and list of candidates, Algorithm starts with both structures empty and adds the first one to the node itself.</p>
                <h5>Repeat:</h5>
                <p>Adds to candidate list of all nodes which are connected to the node just added to the tree (except those already there)<br>
                Of the nodes in the candidate list, moves to the tree (attaching it to the closest neighbor node already there) the one which is the closest to any of the nodes already in the tree<br>
                Repeat as long as there are any nodes left in the candidate list<br>
                This procedure ends with the tree containing all nodes in the network, with the node on which the algorithm is running as the root of the tree. The shortest path from that node to any other node is indicated by the list of the nodes one traverses to get from the root of the tree, to the desired node in the tree</p>

                 Mobile applications require smooth, and transparent transition of usability from host-to-host and across platforms in the course of mobility.<br>
                 Routes provided may be suboptional: Sending and Mobile node may be on the same network, but the home network of the Mobile nodes is far. <br>
                 This is known as the Triangle Problem. Solutions is to let the sending node know the care-of address of the Mobile ndoe.

                <h5>HN - Home Network</h5>
                <p>
                 FA and HA periodically announce their presence to the networks they are attached. This way the MH learns the address of the HA. When the MH attaches to a foreign network it hears an advertisement from a FA and registers with it.
                 <br>The FA contacts the HA providing a care-of address. This is the IP address of the FA.<br>A sending host that wants to send a packet to a MH will send it with a destination address equal to home address of that node. <br> The HA tunnels the packer and sends it to the FA. <br>
                 The FA unwraps the packet and sends it to the Mobile node.

                <p>
                 IP-Address A,B,C class system has ineffeciencies. Effeciencies improves if instead of allocating a class B address, we provide a suffecient amount of class C addresses. For autonomous systems with more than 256 hosts this gives a utilization greater than or equal to 50%.
                 <br>CIDR addresses this problem by aggregating routes. Rather than assigning class C addresses at random they are assigned as a block. The BGP protocol is defined to understand this. All that is needed, is for the router to remember the interval. This can be done by remembering one of two addresses and the range.

                2 parts: Addressing Scheme, and Datagram delivery connectionless model<br>
                Addressing scheme provides a way to identify all hosts.<br>
                The datagram delivery scheme is called best effort because it makes no guarantees. Datagrams are frames that are sent in a connectionless manner. IPv4 Datagrams consist of a header plus a number of data bytes
                </p>
                <p class="text-info">IPv4 Header</p>

                It has a 2 level hierachy: net ID: identifies the network that the host is connected to, Host ID identifies a host on a network.<br>
                IP Addresses are in the form: | CLASS | Net-ID | Host-ID | <br>
                There are five classes of addresses: A, B, C, D, E<br>
                D is used for multicasting and E for experiments, IDs with all 0s or 1s are used for broadcasting: immediately after booting a host may not know its ID, so the host will transmit packets with all 0s to find ID.

                <p>
                Only the router is aware of subnetting<br>
                For IP: 135.27.22.1 - The net-id is 135.27 and the host-id is 22.1, which can be further divided into: subnet-id is 22 and host-id is 1

                <p class="text-info">Subnet Masking</p>
                <p>
                A subnet mask seperates the IP address into the network and the host address. Subnetting further divides the host part of the IP into subnet and host
                It extracts the address of the physical network from an IP address. If there is no subnet it merely extracts the network address from the IP address. 
                If there is subnet division then it extracts the subnet address from the IP address. Masking is also used to hide addresses.
                Calculate the network address: IP ADDRESS BITWISE AND NETWORK MASK

                <p class="text-info">IPv4 Inefficiencies:</p>
                <p>A network with three nodes may be using an entire class C network address (thereby wasting 252 useful addresses), A network with slightly more than 255 hosts is using A class
                   address thereby wasting 64,000 addresses,The more forwarding numbers exist the larger the forwarding tables.
                </p>
                <p class="text-info">IP Datagram Forwarding Algorithm:</p>
                <p>
                Participating nodes compare network part of destination address to see if they are connected to the same network as the destination.<br>
                If match occurs and destination is in same physical network the packet can be directly delivered<br>
                If node is not connected to same physical network all destination datagrams are sent to a router.<br>
                The router does this by consulting a forwarding table.<br>
                There is also a default address used if none of the entries of the forwarding table match the destination address.
                </p>
                <p class="text-info">Address Resolution</p>
                <p>Each host maintains a table of address pairs: IP, MAC<br>

                <p class="text-info">Not Enough Addresses in IPv4</p>
                <p>
                  Before a host can send packets the host needs to know the address of a default router. Operating systems enable IP address configuration. This process is automated by DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol). Large networks have at least one DHCP server.<br>
                  Newly booted hosts sends a DHCP_discover message through DHCP relay. Message sent by UDP, it provides demultiplexing key. <br>
                  Host broadcasts a DHCP discover message in its physical network. Network server(s) respond with a DHCP Offer message. Host selects one of the offers and broadcasts a DHCP Request message (including IP address)<br>
                  Server acknowledges message with DHCP ACK and assigns IP address for a period of time T with 2 thresholds T1, T2. When T1 expires host attempts to extend lease by sending DHCP Request to same server. If accepted host also gets new values T', T1',T2'. If host does not recieve DHCP ACK by time T2 then it broadcasts to any server in the network. <br>
                  If no ACK is recieved by time T then host must relinquish old IP address and begin anew.

                When a TCP sender timesout on a segment it must transmit. Since timeout is probably due to network congestion it is best to reuse the RTO value. This may cause problems when many TCP connections are active. Strategy: TCP source increases its RTO value each time the same segment is retransmitted, this is referred to as the backoff process. TCP source will have to wait longer time for a second retransmission, updating is done according to formula: RTO = qRTO, q is usually 2. Same techniue used in ethernet carrier sensing protocols</p>

                <p>If no segments are retransmitted Jacobsons algorithm works well. When segment timeout and need to retransmitted the RTT values in Jacobsons algorithm are discarded</p>
                <p>
                A new suggestion is: Do not use the measured RTT for a retransmitted segment to update SRTT and SDEV, calculate the backoff RTO when a retransmission occurs, use the backoff RTO value for succeding segments until an ACK arrives for a segment that has not been retransmitted, when such an acknowledgement is recieved Jacobsons algorithm is used to compute future RTO values.

                <p>
                When TCP sender timesout on a segment it must retransmit. Since timeout is probably due to conjestion it is best to reuse RTO value. This may cause problems when many TCP connections are active. The follwing strategy is used by TCP source:<br>
                1. Increase RTO value each time same segment is retransmitted, (this is backoff process). <br>
                2. TCP source will have to wait longer time for a second retransmission. <br>
                3. Update according to: RTO <- qRTO (usually q=2)
                </p>
                <p class="text-info">Window Management</p>
                <p>Size of TCP window can have critical effect on avoiding conjestion in TCP. Four approaches: Slow Start, Dynamic Window Sizing on Congestion, Fast Retransmit, Fast Recovery</p>
                <p class="text-info">Slow Start</p>
                <p>Gradual expansion of window size, constrained by awind={credit, cwind}, where awind is allowed segment in the window, cwind is congestion window used during startup, credit is amount of unused credit granted in most recent ACK.<br>
                Steps: 1. For new connection: cwind=1, 2. Each time an ACK is recieved cwind increases by 1 for each incoming packet. <br>
                Its growth is exponential, bc next time cwind ACKs arrive the new value will be 2cwind.
                </p>
                <p class="text-info">Basic Rule</p>
                <p>Every positive ACK, cwind is increased by 1/cwind, and every time lost packet detected cwind is halved.</p>
                <p class="text-info">Dynamic Window Sizing on Conjestion</p>
                <p>More conservative growth rate than slow start, applies when timeout occurs. <br>
                set slow start threshold: setfresh= cwind/2, setcwind=1 and perform slow start process until cwind=setfresh, here cwind is increased by 1 for every ACK recieved. For cwind less than equal to setfresh increase cwind by one for each round trip time. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-info">Fast Retransmit</p>
                <p>retransmission timer RTO is set, usually somewhat greater than estimated RTT (SRTT) because RTO calculated on the basis of a prediction of next RTT estimated from past values. If delays in source or dest fluctuate then the estimated RTT may be smaller than actual. The dest may not ack each segment individ but cummulatively. <br>
                As consequence  when segment lost TCP may be slow to retransmit.<br>
                Fast Retransmit Rules:
                if TCP entity recieves a segment out of order it must immediately issue an ACK for the last inorder segment that was recieved. TCP continues to repeat ACK with each incoming segment until missing one arrives to fill hole in its buffer. When hole is full TCP sends cummulative ACK.
                </p>
                <p class="text-info">Fast Recovery</p>
                <p>
                 When TCP entity retransmits a segment it assumes segment was lost even though it has not yet timed out on this segment. Assume ACKs eventually arrive indicating the ack of lost segment fast recovery technique is used: retransmit lost segment, cut cwind in half, proceed with linear increase of cwind.
